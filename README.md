Hi there! This repo contains my preregistration and code for my dissertation. 

The pre-processing script contains annotated code for data transformation, cleaning, and some initial exploratory analysis. 

The analysis script contains code for studies 1, 2 and 3, plus some additional post-hoc tests and things I thought would be interesting to study.
